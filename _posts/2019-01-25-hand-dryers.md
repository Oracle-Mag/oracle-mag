During early February, 2018, the internet was roaring about a viral photo posted of a fungi-infested petri dish. This outrage was caused by a simple class assignment, in which Nicole Ward, a microbiology professor, instructed her students to leave an open petri dish for three minutes at a random location, which would then be observed in the following 2 days. One particular petri dish was placed in an enclosed Dyson hand dryer.

Urged by her students, Ward decided to post a sickening photo of the petri dish on Facebook. This post gained a lot of traction, with over 500,000 shares and a reply from Dyson themselves. They stated they were “very surprised to see these results, and unclear on the methodology employed.” The company argued that their filters are able to trap miniscule particles, such as bacteria, and that “Dyson Airblade hand dryers are proven hygienic by university research and are trusted by hospitals, food manufacturers and businesses worldwide.” Ward did state that the petri dish wasn’t tested for pathogens that are harmful to humans, so we have no way of knowing whether the organisms were a health hazard.

A study published by the University of Connecticut and Quinnipiac University in 2018 proved that hand dryers do in fact give birth to colonies of bacteria. Their method consisted of placing open petri dishes in bathrooms under different conditions. When the petri dishes were open for two minutes with the hand dryers off, the petri dishes only grew up to one bacterial colony. However, the petri dishes that were open for 30 seconds with access to the hot air from the hand dryers accumulated up to 254 colonies of bacteria, with the average of between 18 to 60 colonies of bacteria. They then added a filter to these hand dryers, which cut down the colonies by 75%. It seems like Dyson wasn’t lying! The source of the bacteria wasn’t actually from the hand dryers themselves, but actually from the bathroom air.

This leads to the question, are these organisms harmful to us? The answer was mostly positive; Staphylococcus aureus was the only bacterium that is considered harmful to healthy humans, and the bacterium Acinetobacter is only hazardous to people with weak immune systems. Otherwise, the rest of the bacteria were deemed harmless.

In conclusion, what is the most hygienic way to dry your hands? The answer is to use paper towels. A study published in “The Journal of Hospital Infection” in 2017 proved that both jet dryers and warm-air dryers accumulate more bacteria than paper towels; more specifically, people that used the jet dryers had 27 times more bacteria on their hands than the people that used regular paper towels. It is inevitable that bacteria will be on your hands after washing, but paper towels can minimize any harmful risks.
