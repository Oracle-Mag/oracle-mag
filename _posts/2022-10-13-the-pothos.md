Plants are not cheap. Wouldn't it be amazing if we were able to buy a machine that would just constantly generate new plants? Lucky for us, this “machine” already exists. And it's not even a costly initial investment. As you probably guessed, we're talking about propagation, and one of the easiest plants to propagate- the pothos. Not only is it cheap, fast-growing, beautiful, and easy to take care of, it also has numerous different variations meaning your jungle can be built completely off different pothoses.

Don't get the names mixed up! - what are the best subtypes of pothoses for you?

Calling these beautiful plants pothoses is wrong, even though everyone does it. Actual pothoses are entirely different plants- which are however very rare, and for whatever reason, pothos has become a huge marketing name for Epipremnum. The basic one I recommend starting with is Epipremnum aureum:

1. It is the most inexpensive one of them all, and it is a plant-beginner must-have. If you then find that pothoses suit you, you can expand your collection with Epipremnum neon.
2. Epipremnum aureum “marble queen” or “n'joy”, and (my favorite) Epipremnum pictus Argyraeus. The Epipremnum family is huge- there are many more, however, these are the most common ones that are affordable enough to perhaps kill some of them without feeling too guilty.

### How to take care of them

If you've read my last article, you will know that there is no ideal formula for how to take care of plants. To start off tho, it is ideal to water your Epipremnum about once a week, when the top layer of the soil is dry. If in the meantime the leaves become flaccid, you know the plant is desperately craving more water.
Regarding lighting, make sure to provide the plant with as many hours of indirect sunlight as possible. Direct sunlight could burn the leaves. Humidity-wise, the higher the better, so a good placement for pothoses can be the kitchen or the bathroom, however, they don't mind a slightly lower humidity.

### How to turn your Epipremnum into a plant factory

The pothos is fast growing. In the summer, you can expect about 2 new leaves per week. Once the plant is big enough, you can start propagating by cutting off the leaves. For this to work, the leaf has to have a nod (grow point) that's located on the stem. It looks like a tiny dull brownish thorn. Make sure to have at least one leaf and one nod on each of your cuttings. Once you have your cutting(s) prepared, put them in water, and wait for the magic to happen. Roots will start growing from the nods, and once you feel like they're long and strong enough, start gradually putting more and more soil into the water mixture, until the roots acclimate properly to just basic semi-dry soil… and there is your new baby pothos plant. This is the safest way to propagate, however, you can also just pop them right into the soil once they have roots, if you're not patient enough to gradually increase the soil-to-water ratio. To support this root-growing process, you can add lignohumate ( a growth hormone) into the water. It is sold in most hobby shops, and it is also useful in helping plants develop strong root systems even when they're in the water.
