“I was 17 and was raped by a Sotckholm politician who’s now a top candidate in the 2018 election”

“Sitting with colleagues in the dining room hall. One of them fixates his eyes on me and says ‘I can really understand why men rape someimes.’ The other colleagues (male) laugh.”

“We were greeted on the first day of law school with the phrase: Here, we educate Sweden’s best lawyers and Sweden’s most educated housewives” 
“One of the judges became my mentor. He was supportive, offered advice, and one day he came to the office and wanted me to pay him back. In oral sex.” 

When it comes to serious cases of assult, such as rape or any other non-consentual acts, thousands of women who have previously been too scared to speak up have slowly started to speak the truth about what happened to them. This started with the #MeToo movement, and has now become an often occurrence. So why is it that some women who finally collect the courage to speak up about their abuse and name their abusers are slammed with defamation lawsuits? Why is it that in Sweden, for example, not a single woman has ever won this lawsuit? 

Women are being sued for telling their story and trying to protect other women going through the same trauma with the same men. How is it possible that these women are not allowed to name the men who abused them, if their stories are backed up by evidence and testimonies? Why does society shame and exile them for trying to seek justice? In the words of Ms. Wallin (Swedish), whose story I will tell, “Why do I need to keep his secret? His shame? Why is that my responsibility?” 

Yes, in many cases the perpetrator’s reputation can get damaged, which critics call “medieval” or “mob justice.” I say medieval behavior calls for ‘medieval’ punishment. If exposing a predator (is that really ‘medieval’?) is the only way to get justice, then I say it's justified. 
Look at the examples above, taken from Swedish women. If the ‘Stockholm politician’ was named perhaps the woman could have gotten justice and perhaps the government wouldn’t have a sexual offender among them. Now we will never know. If the judge in the second example was named, perhaps it could have saved future women from suffering through the same behavior. It is time to stop protecting the shame of these predominantly male criminals and allow victims to seek the justice they deserve, without the fear of facing a defamation lawsuit. Because if this was the case, women wouldn't have to fear calling out the next ‘Stockholm politician’ or ‘judge’ by name. Women wouldn’t have to fear risking their liberty to get justice. Women could protect future women from these predators.

I admit that in some cases it can be hard to distinguish what actually happened, but in the majority of cases, all women want is peace of mind and justice. Ms Wallin made an Instagram post about Mr Vritanen, saying his name and what he did to her. It was backed by testimony from her friends, accounts from her therapist to whom she told her traumatic tale, and other women abused by the perpetrator. Yet all of this was somehow not enough for the court to believe Ms Wallin. Instead, after simply saying these claims were made up, Frederik Vritanen walked away unscathed, while Ms Wallin now faces two years in prison for defamation (destroying one’s reputation). 

The story of Ms. Wallin is just one of many cases in which society, as well as the legal system, have failed women. Instead of bringing her justice after being raped and assulted, the legal system and her assaulter himself have slammed her with a lawsuit. All because she was brave enough to name the man who abused her. I say this is inexcusable and disappointing, especially considering that we are living in the twenty-first century. Women deserve justice, not lawsuits.
