You might have heard of one of the most peculiar “incidents” of the 20th century called Incident at Dyatlov Pass, and you also might have heard about the suspicious circumstances surrounding the incident. Although the generally accepted explanation for the deaths of nine experienced russian ski-hikers is a natural disaster of some sort, such as a hurricane or an avalanche, the mountain of contradicting evidence points to the possibility of a more sinister truth. 

During the icy February of 1959, a group of young students of the Ural Polytechnical Institute set out on a hike through the northern Ural mountains of Russia. They planned a route that no Russian had ever taken in high spirits, documenting their excitement in diary entries and photographs. Their enthusiasm, however, would soon run out. On February 1st, the hikers set up camp on mountain Kholat Syakhl. On February 26th, all nine hikers were found dead, their bodies scattered across the snow-covered terrain. All hikers bore marks of hypothermia, although upon closer inspection it would later become evident that some inexplicable, perhaps even unnatural force drew the hikers to their gruesome deaths. 

The hikers’ tent was ripped open from the inside with a knife, as if the hikers were desperate to escape, although it is unclear from what. Searchers discovered the hikers’ boots, clothes, maps and food inside the tent - items one would expect to have on them while leaving the tent. The searchers followed the path of footprints left behind which extended about a half a kilometer from the tent before the trail had been covered in snow. Having no other evidence of a trail, they simply continued in the direction the footprints had been heading in. Soon, they discovered the remains of an improvised fire next to the shoeless and clothless bodies of 21-year-old Yuri Doroshenko and 23-year-old Yuri Krivonischenko, just in their underwear. Although both hikers had frozen to death, they also had burns and multiple abrasions. 

Two more bodies were then found deeper in the woods, facing the direction of the tent as if the hikers had been trying to get back. A few days later, a fifth body was found with a fractured skull, also seemingly as a result of attempts to return to the tent. All the bodies were covered in cuts, bruises and scratches. By this point, investigators had begun considering the daunting possibility of homicide. But no evidence of foul play or a murder weapon had been discovered to support their suspicions. They hoped the discovery of the remaining 4 bodies would help explain what had happened. They were wrong.

As the snow began to melt, a hunter came across the remains of an interim snow shelter, located about 250 feet from the tree where the two burned bodies were found. Inside the shelter they found bedding made from branches, cotton sweatpants missing one leg and the half of a woman’s sweater. Finally, a thorough search through 10 feet of snow uncovered the four missing bodies on a rocky stream bed, revealing one of the hikers had suffered a severe head injury with pieces of a bone driven into the brain, while the others had crushed chests and broken ribs. Inexplicably, one hiker was missing their eyes, tongue and upper lip. The bodies of the four remaining hikers were also found to be wearing clothing that seemed to have been removed or cut from the first five bodies. To add to the mystery, many of these clothing items were found to emit very high levels of radiation.

The investigation was abruptly shut down on May 28th with the conclusion that hikers were met with an “overwhelming force which they were not able to overcome”. Many have however not accepted this vague explanation, and the mystery surrounding the incident fuelled decades of speculation and conspiracy theories, each more far-fetched than the other. The incident has been mostly linked to natural disasters, gravity anomalies, or possibly some kind of drug overdose, but some are convinced that the tragedy was caused by the KGB, a Russian version of the Yeti, or a UFO attack. Although there is little credibility to these theories, time and new investigative techniques have produced more realistic explanations. A filmmaker researching the Dyatlov Pass incident for a documentary recently suggested that the hikers died due to a real phenomenon called “infrasound”, where wind reacts with topography to create a low-frequency sound barely detectable by the human ear, the vibrations of which may cause disorientation, nausea, and vomiting accompanied by feelings of panic or dread. Somehow, the effects of infrasound could have driven the hikers out of their tents, where they were met with extreme temperatures and in their disoriented state were unable to return back. Many aspects of the hikers’ deaths, however, such as burns and missing eyes, are not as easily accounted for with the infrasound explanation, and it remains a theory for now. To this day it is still unclear as to what happened that night in the Ural mountains. Whatever forces were responsible for the deaths of the nine hikers may lie beyond our current understanding of the physical world, and it might be a while before we come to fully fathom the cause of the incident.
