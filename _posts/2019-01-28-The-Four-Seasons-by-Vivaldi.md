Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi is arguably best known for his group of compositions: The Four Seasons. A breath-taking collection of four violin concerti, each representing a season of the year. Although classical ballets such as the Nutcracker or Sleeping Beauty are based on narratives, portraying the cycle of the seasons accompanied by Vivaldi's masterpiece through ballet would be simply gorgeous. I have designed a couple of ballet costume ideas titled according to the season. I have tried to incorporate elements of the baroque period into modern designs. Alongside them, I have written a few lines of poetry inspired by Vivaldi, to reflect the feeling of the music. However, I would recommend listening for yourself, because you can never hear these compositions too many timesâ€¦

*Spring*
A silver stream murmurs sweetly,
Carried by a gentle breeze.
Flowers sway in an infusion of colour.
Spring has arrived and the birds above
Awaken the blossoming meadow with their song. 

*Summer* 
All is washed in gold
Under the merciless sun of the season. 
Even her fearful eyes as she gazes up.  
The goldfinch cries out in warning.
Alas, the rain comes down. 
Thunder and lightning sent down from the heavens. 

*Autumn*
The forest transforms into colours of dawn.
The warm air and the soft glow of light invites all to dance and sing,
A moment of peace, as nature prepares for its final act.

*Winter*
Shivering, frozen, trapped in a whirlwind of snow.
To feel the tiny blades of ice, coarse against your cheek. 
The winter is cruel. 
But to spend quiet times by the fire,
To walk on the ice with careful steps,
To gaze out onto the endless blanket. 
The winter is cruel, but it brings us warmth.
