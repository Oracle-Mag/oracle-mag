It was a normal Friday night, and I was visiting my friend in a small town outside of Prague. Wanting to get some fresh air, we went for a short stroll around the lake (keep in mind that this was during the 9 p.m. curfew caused by covid).  The first strange occurrence of the night was the local castle guard shining his lantern on us and following us, ushering us home for the approaching curfew. Reluctant to leave the peaceful setting of the frozen lake, we slowly made our way up the hill back to the house. 
 
Just as we turned the corner onto my friend’s street, we were met head-on by two strange figures. At first glance, nothing seemed wrong; just two people, a man and a woman, on a late-night walk. But then my eyes caught a glimpse of what the man was gripping in both his hands; machetes. You heard me. Yes, machetes - those long, sharp knives. Even stranger, he was dressed from head to toe in a black tight suit, resembling the one that ninjas wear. On his chest he wore leather combat armor, and stretched over on his face was a black balaclava, as black as the sky now was.  Now I know how strange this sounds - I couldn’t believe my eyes either - but I promise you it's true. After my eyes darted over him I threw the woman a quick glance. With a pointy dagger in her right hand, she stared me right in the eye. For the first time in my life, I was stunned and couldn’t process what I was seeing.  My friend and I acted as if we saw nothing. If we don’t react, they won’t bother us, we thought. We cautiously continued down the badly lit road, silently begging our feet to move faster. We were about ten meters past them when my friend did the unthinkable; she started laughing. And better yet, I’m contagious to laughter, so I cracked up with her. The whole situation seemed too unrealistic to be true; we must have been having visions. But boy, was it real. 

I nudged my friend, too scared to speak, who was as dumb-found and paralyzed as I was. Suddenly, the man started shouting at us. I was too scared to comprehend his words, but his aggressive tone was obvious. With one look at each other, my friend and I started racing down the street, running for our lives - literally. I don’t think I’ve ever run as fast. Behind my shoulder I could still hear shouting, but now it was accompanied by impeding footsteps as well. The ninja was chasing us. 

Luckily, my friend’s house was close, and we reached the front door within a matter of minutes. We desperately banged on the door, wailing for someone, anyone, to let us in. Unluckily, everyone was either asleep or couldn’t hear us. Even better, the phone we had with us was dead. In retrospect, it probably wasn’t the best idea to scream, alerting the strange man of our whereabouts, but we didn’t really have time to think. Thank God, the door soon opened and we toppled inside, locking it shut behind us. We staked out by the top floor window, having knives at the ready if he decided to follow us, but luckily, that was the last we saw of him.

Why we met a ninja with machetes that night, we shall never know. But two lessons can be learned from our spine-chilling experience. One: don’t be as stupid as us and don’t laugh at ninjas! Two: please, if you ever decide to go out at night (which you probably shouldn’t), don’t be unprotected. There is always space in your pocket for pepper spray. After all, you never know what kinds of people you can meet at night. Hopefully not a machete-wielding maniac. 

*Stay safe!*
