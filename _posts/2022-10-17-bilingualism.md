As we all attend an international school, there is a high chance that you are probably bilingual or even trilingual. Not only are there many bilingual students in this school, but we also learn a third language that further adds to our language acquisition. Being bilingual brings us many advantages, such as new perspectives about different cultures, different ways of thinking and new creative approaches. Since bilingualism brings us many advantages, does it necessarily mean that it makes us any smarter than someone monolingual? 

Early studies suggest that bilingualism does make people smarter; a study from 2012 shows that there are cognitive benefits of speaking a second language. 121 children took part in this study, and they were either bilingual or monolingual. The monolingual children spoke only English or Italian, and the bilingual participants spoke minority languages - Scottish Gaelic or Sardinian - on top of these national languages. The children were administered 4 cognitive tests; these included cognitive control, problem-solving ability, metalinguistic awareness and working memory.

Confirming their hypothesis, the results showed that the bilingual children outperformed the monolingual children on 2 out of the 4 cognitive tests. Surprisingly, the results also showed that the children that were fluent in both English and Scottish Gaelic outperformed the children that spoke Italian and Sardinian in one of the cognitive tests. The reason for this occurrence was due to the fact that Scottish Gaelic was formally taught in schools, whereas Sardinian was only spoken at home. Interestingly, this study shows that formal education in a language further improves your intelligence - speaking a language at home isn’t enough.

On the other hand, The University of Western Ontario came to the conclusion that there are “no general cognitive advantages” to being bilingual. Published in 2020 and consisting of 11,041 participants, the study assessed a group of bilinguals and monolinguals on 12 different cognitive tests. These results might surprise you; the bilingual group performed better only on 1 of the cognitive tests, but the monolingual group actually outperformed the bilingual group on 4 of the tests. When the groups were matched to remove potentially confounding factors, the difference in the results were negligible.

This doesn't necessarily mean that there are no advantages to being bilingual; even one of the experimenters from this study stated that “Despite there being no cognitive advantage, the broader social, employment, and lifestyle benefits that are available to speakers of a second language are clearly numerous.” An article from Psychology Today also states that bilingualism leads to greater creativity. They say that bilingualism is a great way to access “new experience, new thought, new vision, and new solutions.”

If you were to ask someone on the street, “Are bilingual people smarter and monolingual people?” the chances are that they would say that bilingual individuals are smarter. The studies above might have had a different idea of what it means to be “smart,” as there is smartness in regards to IQ and smartness according to emotional intelligence. Although these studies may or may not be true, languages are definitely valuable assets. Languages open doorways into different cultures and their opposing values through the beauty of words. Whether it be different dialects or colloquialisms, there is always something one can appreciate about their language and their cultural background.
