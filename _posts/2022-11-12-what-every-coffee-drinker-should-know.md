With over 167 million 60kg bags consumed globally, coffee - the most popular caffeinated beverage- has become an essential drink routine for everyone. Caffeine is also included in many other of our favourite drinks, including green tea, Coke or energy drinks. This addictive substance, in many ways, works similarly to any other drug. High consumption of coffee results in higher tolerance and more frequent cravings. Five to thirty minutes after the consumption of caffeine it’s common to experience a rise in body temperature, dehydration, dizziness, and increased heart rate. According to Mayo Clinic, it is suggested that we don’t consume more than 400mg a day. This value may change depending on individual factors such as age or body mass.

Caffeine is a mild stimulant for the human body, meaning that it gives a burst of energy, which we typically use to get more work done etc. It inhibits the increase of a chemical called adenosine, which is the body's natural “tiredness chemical. Adenosine gradually increases throughout the day causing us to get more and more tired, however when we consume caffeine, adenosine concentrations rise slower, therefore, we are less tired. The downside of caffeine is that once its effects fade, all of the adenosine which would normally be in the system gets flooded in. This causes us to be sleepy and is the main reason why people tend to have more coffee per day. On the other hand, caffeine does provide many benefits such as enhanced alertness, improved athletic performance, elevated mood and an increased metabolic rate.

In connection with the facts stated in the first and second paragraphs, the optimal dosing for coffee that contains caffeine is to have approximately one or two cups. The best time to consume caffeine is between the mid-morning and early afternoon. This will produce the much-desired “boost of energy” and allow the body's adenosine levels to normalize so we still have energy for the evening and can sleep well.

Although there are some mild risks involved with caffeine and its overconsumption, it is still a very useful instrument to, for example, get more work done. However, it can get quite expensive. How can you successfully grow a coffee plant? Coffee plants can grow inside and outside and under with the help of three main abiotic factors: diffused sunlight, high temperature and constant humidity levels. Freshly picked coffee cherries or green seeds from an arabica coffee plant are planted into the soil. The soil needs to be rich in nutrients and with a pH of 6. Once the plant starts growing, the soil needs to stay only slightly moist at all times. You need to use a pebble tray filled with water to maintain constant humidity levels. Growing a coffee plant takes patience, it takes a long time for the plant to start producing cherries. Once it starts producing them it takes another full year for them to ripen.

In conclusion, if you need extra energy or would like to increase your mood, metabolic rate or athletic performance - caffeine is the answer. However, the consumption of high doses - above 400mg - can cause unpleasant short and long-term symptoms. Additionally, if you would like to grow your own coffee, try the tips in the paragraph above.
