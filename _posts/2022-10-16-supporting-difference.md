Sexual and gender identity plays a very large role in the young lives of today’s population. It becomes a very sensitive and important topic in a young person’s life, figuring out who they are and who they like. And the pressure they get from people on the outside does not help. This is why it is important to educate ourselves on this topic and all the things surrounding it as it may help people understand more. 
	
Although there are many things young adults and teenagers struggle with these days, the two I will be talking about in this article are gender identity and sexual orientation. For starters, it is important to understand the difference between the two. Sexual orientation is the emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to another person. Whereas gender identity is the way a person perceives themselves. 

You may all know of the LGBTQ+ initialism, if not well, these are initials of all the sexualities which aren’t considered ‘the norm’. This initialism has been in use since the 1990s and was created when a group of people who were a part of this community decided they wanted to be heard. Over the years, this community has become a safe place for people who struggle with their sexual orientation; and with social media growing many people have found that talking to people part of the community online has helped them more than talking to their parents for instance. This is the problem. 

There are still parents out there, and people in general, who do not accept this. There are many people who still aren’t able to get over the fact that their child may be a little different. So what? We live in a society where this is a very significant part of a child’s life yet your sexual orientation more affects where you end up than the amount of money you have or your history. This is exactly why we need to educate everybody about sexual orientation and gender identity.

There are many rumours going around stating that being gay is a disease and that it's contagious. Or that if you are a lesbian then you are more likely to get other diseases such as cancer. These rumours are just that. Rumours. Sexual orientation and gender identity are nothing but a preference and a feeling. If you’re a heterosexual woman and are friends with a lesbian the only difference between the two of you is your preference for a sexual or romantic partner. That is it. There is nothing else. Neither of you is more or less likely to get a specific disease or anything else. It is important for the older generation, and a few minorities in this generation, to understand this fact. 

Although to a heterosexual, sexual orientation may not mean much, it is a very important part of who a person is sometimes. And when there are people who discriminate, bully or judge people of the LGBTQ+ community it can cause serious damage that they may not even realize they are doing. 

As many may know, suicide is one of the leading causes of death of today’s youth and members of the LGBTQ+ community are four times more likely to attempt suicide. So the next time you see someone being bullied or hear rude comments, please make sure to defend your friend and reassure them that there is nothing wrong with them. Words can do more damage than we may think.  Below are some links which may help you understand this topic more:
