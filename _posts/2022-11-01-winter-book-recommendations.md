### Books

#### Before the Coffee Gets Cold — Toshikazu Kawaguchi

<!-- create a div with three columns -->
<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between;">
<p>
This book is set in a small underground cafe in Tokyo which has been serving a special type of coffee for over one hundred years. However, it also offers its customers the unique experience to be able to travel back in time. The book explores the stories of four customers each of which has a different reason to confront the past. They use the cafe’s time-travelling offer to confront a past lover about why they left them, to meet the daughter they never got the chance to meet, to receive a letter from a loved one whose memory had been taken early by a degenerative neurological disease and to see their sister one last time. There is only one catch; the customers must sit in a specific seat and return to the present before their coffee gets cold…

#### If We Were Villains — M.L Rio

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between;">
<p>
This book tells the story of Oliver Marks, who has just served 10 years in prison for the murder of one of his closest friends (which he may or may not have committed). Before he retires, the detective that put Oliver in prison wants to hear the true story of what happened that day 10 years ago. Oliver had been part of a group of young actors studying Shakespeare at an elite arts conservatory, and Oliver noticed that his cast mates began to act as their characters even off stage; the villain, the hero, the temptress, while Oliver was always left to play insignificant roles. However, when their teacher decides to change up the casting, their good-hearted rivalry turns ugly leaving one of the seven friends dead. The rest of the group faces a new acting challenge; convincing the police of their innocence.

#### The Atlas Six — Olivie Blake

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between;">
<p>
The Alexandrian society is that of the best magical academics in the world. Each decade a set number of especially talented magicians is admitted to compete for a spot in the institute ensuring them a life of wealth, power and prestige. Among these are cosmologists, mind readers, those who can unveil the secrets of the universe and those who can end it, if only they so wish. The candidates are given a year to live together in the institute and attempt to bring about the greatest contributions to arcane areas of knowledge. Those who succeed, survive, those who don’t, do not…

#### Jane Eyre — Charlotte Bronte

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between;">
<p>
This book is one of the classics we have decided to include in this list. It tells the story of Jane who had been orphaned as a young child. She is hired as a nanny by Edward Rochester to work at Thornfield Hall. Jane is somehow drawn to his troubled yet kind spirit and finds herself in love with the man, yet her courage is tested once again as she discovers the terrifying secrets of Thornfield Hall and Mr Rochester himself.

#### Frankenstein — Mary Shelley

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between;">
<p>
Yet another infamous classic, ideal for Halloween time. This book tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a swiss natural science student, who pieces together a creature from pieces of corpses and proceeds to bring it to life. Despite seeking affection, the monster seems to do nothing but evoke loathing in everyone he meets. The novel is very politically charged, emphasized by Shelley’s strong female voice, and it explores the dangers of technological advancement (how far is too far?).

#### The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue — V.E Schwab

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between;">
<p>
In a moment of desperation, a young woman takes a bargain to live forever under one condition: she will be forgotten by everyone she ever meets. And so begins Addie’s journey across the entire world through art and across history, as she goes to extreme lengths in an attempt to leave her mark on the world. But in a dramatic turn of events, after 300 years, Addie meets a man in a bookstore that magically remembers her name.

#### The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo — Taylor Jenkins Reid

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between;">
<p>
The timeless Hollywood icon, Evelyn Hugo, is finally ready to tell the story of her glamorous, but also undeniably scandalous, life in a memoir to be released after her death. To nobody’s understanding, she chooses a so far unknown magazine writer, Monique Grant, for the job. Nevertheless, Monique takes the job and so Evelyn’s storytelling begins from her leaving Cuba after her mother’s death, to covering the good, the bad and the ugly of show business and the story of her one true but forbidden love. Just as the bond between Monique and Evelyn grows quite strong and her story begins to come to a close, it becomes clear that their life stories are critically intersecting in a very tragic way.
