In this article, I would like to dive into the whole concept of fast fashion and how nowadays it is especially important to be conscious of what is happening in the background of the clothing industry.

The fashion industry has been increasingly prevalent in the last centuries. In the past few years, microtrends have risen up due to very fast innovation of new styles and their further distribution via social media such as Tiktok or Instagram. This leads to the general public demanding those products as soon as possible in order to fit in with the newest trends. The fashion industry has acknowledged this behaviour and decided to act upon it in order not to lose its customer base and loyalty of those customers.
 
To attain those rapidly changing trends they, therefore, design and produce new clothes and accessories in a very short period of time which has ultimately shortened the whole process from 3-9 months into a span of 2-4 weeks.

Since the fashion industry also takes into consideration the competitiveness of the market, they have to accustom the prices of their products in order to not be perceived as unaffordable. The fact that clothing brands need to be able to produce those large quantities of cheap clothes means they have to cut down the cost of production, therefore they resolve it by using cheap labour forces and materials of lower quality. 

This concept is highly problematic as it raises the issues of exploitation of workers and damage to the environment. Large companies are able to overcome ethical considerations and legislation by decentralising their manufacturing plants into poor economies, where the people are forced to work in bad conditions for very small amounts of money. The environmental side of this issue relates to the mass production of clothes that leads to a larger demand for cheap materials such as plastics and therefore plays a huge role in creating carbon emissions in the production, packaging and distribution processes. 

If you don't feel comfortable contributing to this system, firstly try not to be so hard on yourself as all of us are constantly exposed to this as it has been highly normalised. It is also understandable that affordable and trendy clothing seems to be the easiest option for people who cannot invest in ethically manufactured clothing as it is usually more expensive and doesn't follow the latest trend schemes.

However, in your future purchase try considering if you are capable of outwearing all of the items for multiple occasions or if you will only wear each item once or twice. In that case, try to look through your wardrobe and buy clothes that are suitable for more outfits and thus you can reuse them.

You can also visit various second-hand shops or thrift stores if you want to diversify your style with unique items whilst still staying on budget, meaning you will prevent yourself from supporting the overall mass production of clothing so you will not only indirectly help with expressing your opinion towards unethical practices but you'll also help with the environmental side of fast fashion. Prague offers a large variety of those stores but for thrifting beginners; I would recommend Textil house or Genesis.
