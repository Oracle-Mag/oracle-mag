This term I went through the chaotic process of applying to college. I spent months working on my personal statement for the UK, college essays for the US, and motivation letters for Spain. It was one of the most challenging journeys I’ve been through, but with the wonderful help of Ms Emerich, all the friends that I kept annoying to read my essays, and various coaches that checked them from an academic standpoint, I have finally finished. Even though it took me many months to figure out how to write the essays best, I think there are things that I could have done to make the process much more efficient and timely. For that reason, I am writing this article, so that I can share the wisdom I’ve acquired over these past few months with you, to hopefully make your application to college (whenever it may be) much easier than mine was. I will start off with some general advice, and then give some specific pointers on both the UK’s Personal Statement and the US’s Common Application Essay as well as supplemental essays.

### General advice applicable to any college essay-writing process:

#### Know what you want to write about

I know this may seem like the most generic piece of advice I could give you, but it could not be more true. When I sat down to start writing my essays, I thought it would be a quick process. But when I actually started writing, I realized I didn’t know what I wanted to say; I didn’t know myself. I started asking myself questions to try and see my motivations, characteristics, and reasons for wanting to study this degree, but realized I didn’t fully know - how was I supposed to write my essays then?

To avoid this, before you begin the process, make a bullet point list of your specific motivations for wanting to study this degree. Don’t be vague; admission officers will not be impressed by you saying _“I have been interested in Economics ever since I can remember, and because it's important to humanity.”_ A sentence like this a) has no substance, b) gives no real unique reason, and c) is not true (you weren’t interested in medicine when you were three years old and could barely speak!). Instead, try something like this (this is from my own personal statement): _“My ambition to study economics stems from my desire to explore both mathematics and humanities, setting me on the career path of developing socially beneficial policies.“_

#### Write about yourself

Again, this may seem obvious, but you would be surprised. When I wrote the first draft of my personal statement I got so caught up in showing the admissions officer every book I read and every summer course I took, and analysing them in such detail, that the focus of the personal statement was on the merits and drawbacks of _Why Nations Fail_ instead of why I’m a capable candidate. The college essays are a way for admissions officers to get to know you as a person, your unique interests, and your reasons for choosing this degree. So by all means, talk about the books you’ve read and summer courses you took/job experiences you have, but make sure to always bring the focus back to you. Instead of summarizing the plot of a book, talk about its impact on you and how that developed your thinking. What was your reaction? What did you do to explore an alternative view? How has that changed your motivation for wanting to pursue this course?

#### Be unique

One of your most important missions in writing your college essays should be to stand out from the crowd. Chances are, that the university you’re applying to has hundreds of applicants with perfect grades and letters of recommendation just like you. Make sure to distinguish yourself from others, whether it's through an original opinion (perhaps on current affairs), a unique and quirky hobby (jump-roping, rowing, origami…), or a long-standing dedication to one area of study. You want to be memorable, so make sure your essays aren’t boring or expected, and show the admissions officers how the university will be more diverse with you attending.

#### Practical note

Have 2-4 people read your statement. I don’t recommend having more than 5 people read it, as there will be too many opinions and by trying to please everyone you will end up losing focus and your original intention.

##### Personal statement-specific advice:

1. Include a discussion of books and literature that you have read, but make sure it's not a list - the officers want to see your critical thinking and evaluation of the literature.
2. Have a balanced view. Don’t just show one interpretation of a problem, but show that you sought the opinion of the other side, by, for example, reading a book with a contrasting point of view. Only after seeing both sides evaluate them.
3. Extracurricular activities (ECs) should not be the focus of your essay. It is good to have a paragraph at the end discussing them, but what UK Universities care about more is who you are as a student and why you are interested in this course specifically. By all means,s use the ECs as a segway to talking about your motivations, but make sure the statement doesn’t read like a resume.

##### US University-specific advice:

1. Be open and honest and share something personal.
2. Talk about your values and what is important to you

3. Do your college research - why do you want to apply to this school specifically?
4. Sell yourself - be confident, but not overly confident - there is a fine line between being a show-off and being a competent individual.
5. 4-minute story. When writing the Common App it is said that the most effective way to begin is why sharing a short story about 4 minutes of your life that had a remarkable impact on you.
