**THE MOST PAINFUL BOOK IN HISTORY IS...**

**...CAIN'S JAWBONE** 

Behind a wonderful and innocent looking cover lays 100 pages of multiple murder mysteries printed in the wrong order and assembled into a book. Cain's Jawbone is one of the first murder mystery puzzle novels. The author, Torquemada, made sure the book was almost impossible to solve. 

Surprisingly however, the book became a large interest amongst the readers. In fact, when the book was published, both in 1934 and 2019, it was accompanied by a competition with a cash prize; roughly about £1000. Only 3 people had solved it since the book came out almost 90 years ago: in 1935, Mr. Sydney-Turner and Mr. Kennedy, and in 2020 Mr. Finnemore. 

There is something funny about how Mr. Finnemore achieved solving the puzzle. When the competition was announced, it was shortly before the COVID-19 lockdown. After Mr. Finnemore solved the puzzle he said: “The first time I had a look at it I quickly thought ‘Oh this is just way beyond me.’ The only way I’d even have a shot at it was if I were for some bizarre reason trapped in my own home for months on end, with nowhere to go and no-one to see. Unfortunately, the universe heard me.” I guess he kept himself quite busy during the lockdown - unlike the rest of us who longed for some entertainment. 

It is understandable that some people may view this as a form of torture, though. I mean, you can’t curl up in bed and read it just for fun, as it wouldn’t make any sense. It would be a pain to read. So in some cases it could be put into one of the “Top 10 books you don’t want to read” lists on buzzfeed or some other website.

However, to me it seems like a very fun and light activity for a lazy day. If a person doesn’t pressure themselves about solving it right away or at all, it seems as a good time filler for a day when a person just wants to lay in bed or stay away from people and have a day for themselves. Cozy up with a cup of coffee or tea and stare at a wall of paper. Not crazy… relaxing. 

**In case that isn’t for you, here are some of my personal favorite books that aren’t a pain to read. There’s a few older classics and then some modern YA novels as well as a non-fiction book which I found very interesting, especially for young students.**
