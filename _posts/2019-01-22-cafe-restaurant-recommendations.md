*If you're bored of still visiting the same places over and over again, we created a list of restaurants and coffee shops, which are probably not so well known, but are totally worth visiting!  So for every occasion you might need to find a place where to eat or just get coffee - this is the list you've been looking for.*

**Restaurants**
                                                       
·Cantina·

If you're wondering where to go to eat lunch or dinner and you don't want to go the same place as you always go - try Cantina, a Mexican restaurant on the side of Náplavka. The service is very nice and quick and the food is delicious with a big variety of typical Mexican dishes. 

·Marthy's Kitchen·

Marthy's kitchen is a very good brunch spot for when you want to go out with some friends. Their menu consists of eggs, pastries, fresh smoothies and a lot more! They serve their morning breakfast menus up until four in the afternoon so you don't have to rush out of bed :) 

·Smetana Q·

I would consider this place like a cousin to Marthy's kitchen. They also serve brunches but way more sweet pastries and cakes to choose from if you're a sweet breakfast kinda person. They also have a lunch menu, which like the breakfast one, consists of fresh ingredients and is all home-made. I would recommend stopping for coffee at least as well. 

·Sushi Oishi·

If you're a lover of sushi, you need to visit this place. Their sushi is spectacular, the service is super nice and the whole interior of the restaurant is very cute. It is located near Palladium. 

·Gambero Rosso·

And now for the lovers of Italian food… Gambero rosso is a very nice Italian based restaurant with all the Italian food an Italian restaurant should offer. They have a special new lunch menu every week. It's a little pricey but very worth it. 

·Maitrea Restaurant·

The Maitrea restaurant is a vegetarian restaurant. They also have a new weekly menu every week and also have all and any other allergens written right on the menu card. They have a wide selection of soups, salads, appetizers, main course and of course desserts. 

**Snacks & Sweets**

*I think all of us had experienced a very bad day. Whether it is school related stuff or anything else… I think one of the best ways to cheer yourself up is to treat yourself! Sweet food is definitely a great way to do that.* 

·Oh deer bakery·

That would be my personal favourite place to go to when I'm feeling down. They have a huge range of different flavored donuts which are to die for. It might be a bit expensive, but once in a while I think it's worth spending money on something this good! 

·Coffee and waffles·

They offer delicious but not so traditional breakfasts. You can choose from a gluten free version to a sweet or salty dish. As you probably guessed by the name, waffles are definitely their specialty. They again have a huge variety of different flavors you can choose from so all of your tastes are satisfied :)

**Cafés**                    

·Mistral Cafe·

A modern café with an elegant interior, where freshly cut flowers and large windows create a calm and unique atmosphere. It is a perfect brunch destination. If you're just stopping by, you can enjoy a coffee or fresh lemonade.

·Myraw Cafe

If you're looking for plant-based options, visit Myraw cafe. Although it is in the center of Prague, the interior is very cozy. You can enjoy coffee or tea with desserts that are made from fresh, quality ingredients. 

·Dobrá Trafika

 A comfortable cafe with probably the greatest variety of teas and coffees. They play great music, the interior is unique and you can borrow board games and books while you're there. As the name suggests, you can also purchase magazines, books, art, postcards and other necessities you'd find in any “dobrá trafika.” 

·Kafé a Hrnky·

 What's special about this cafe is that on its top floor is a pottery studio. This means that you can paint on  a dish of your choice while sipping your freshly brewed coffee. It is an incredibly relaxing and rewarding experience; within a week, you can pick up your masterpiece.
