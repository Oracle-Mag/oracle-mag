What do you think mathematicians do when a problem seems to be unsolvable? They solve it by means of creating another ‘problem’. This, per se, is how infamous imaginary numbers were invented (or discovered?). 

### Early beginning of imaginary numbers 
In the 1520s, a professor at the University of Bologna in Italy, Scipione del Ferro, faced a problem while solving a cubic equation as it required him to take a square root out of a negative number. Later on, in his book Ars Magna, which was aimed at summarising all of the algebraic axioms, the professor concluded that this group of cubic equations is physically unsolvable. 
 
$$
x^3 + px = 0 \\
x \cdot (x^2 + p) = 0 \\
x = 0
$$

or 

$$
x^2 + p = 0 \\
x^2 = -p \\
x = \sqrt{-p}  \\
\sqrt{-p} \not \subset \mathbb{R}
$$

### Development of the idea of complex numbers 
Later on, in the 1550s, another Italian professor, Rafael Bombelli came up with the unit- i, introducing the imaginary numbers more formally. He first referred to it, in rather a paradoxical way, calling i ‘the more of the less’. This is as i allowed mathematicians to obtain a square root out of a negative number. 
At the beginning of its existence, such an addition to the common rules of algebra did not appeal to many mathematicians. In turn, they often referred to it as useless and did not give it as much meaning as it could not have been found in nature. This led to them abandoning the idea of i - something that cannot be imagined or shown physically. This way, in the 1600s, French philosopher René Descartes argued that no structure in geometry that correlates to the use of imaginary numbers can be represented visually. 

### Practical use of imaginary numbers
In physics, however, the problems caused by imaginary numbers were disregarded and discredited in favour of their practical usefulness. An example of such use - differentiation that is so abundant in physics and commonly occurring in Issac Newton’s laws of classical mechanics, applications of Gustav Kirchoff’s laws, Maxwell’s equations from electromagnetism, as well as Schrödinger’s equation of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, they were helpful in wave functions of quantum mechanics, modelling oscillations that had properties of complex amplitudes. However, the question was still open- even quantum mechanics could not show, describe or prove the existence of something so abstract- something so unperceivable and unsettling in one’s brain. This, however, did not prevent further development of the use of imaginary numbers in quantum physics. This is due to the fact that in quantum mechanics the use of imaginary numbers was aimed at improving conciseness, as well as describing concepts and conditions of quantum mechanics, such as wave functions, that could not be characterised by general mathematical axioms. In fact, the most generic description of any abstraction in quantum physics would include the unit of the square root of a negative number- i. This is as quantum physics- the study of matter on the most fundamental level, looking at energies of basic building blocks of all life; by default is very complex, with the simplest explanation including complex numbers (i).

### Are imaginary numbers actually imaginary? 
Although there are still arguments regarding the origins of imaginary numbers and their usefulness, the world around us is still a construct of wave functions, according to quantum theory. Wave functions, in turn, cannot be described or even partially perceived without the use of complex numbers; concluding that imaginary numbers do, in fact, have a very high chance of being within the boundary of nature.
