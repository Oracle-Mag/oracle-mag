**The 25th of February, 2022.**

Dear Reader…

> We live in a world in which we need to share responsibility. It’s easy to say it’s not my child, not my community, not my world, not my problem, then there are those who see the need and respond. I consider those people my heroes.
    - Fred Rogers

The war in Ukraine started on the 25th of February 2022. Today, that's exactly 245 days since people's lives have been turned upside down, since the definition of the word \_war \_has been permanently engraved into the minds of Ukrainian children, never to be forgotten again. And whilst hospitals are being bombed, homes are being destroyed and families are being torn apart, my life simply goes on, mostly unaffected.

I think the biggest eye-opener was actually meeting a Ukrainian refugee, not just reading an impersonal article on the matter. She was a twelve-year-old girl, and the first thing I thought of was that she could serve as an example to most of us. Uprooting your life at any age isn't easy, especially when you're so young, but she carried herself with such grace that you would never be able to see a hint of anger or sadness on her face. That's not to say that she didn't feel all of those emotions, but she took her current situation in stride, equal to one of a person three times her age. When talking about her old life in Ukraine, she described it in a way that mirrored my own. Her words were laced with love and hope, rather than resentment and anger. I can't say that I would have had or currently have enough maturity in me to have taken all of that with as much selflessness. There was an undeserved kindness to her, and I don't think I've ever felt more proud to be Ukrainian than in that moment. To know that I share something with her, and with a country that has the will to fight for what is theirs, was a feeling that words aren't and will never be capable of doing any justice to.

However, pride is often replaced by guilt. The words “I'm tired” are ones I like to throw around frequently, although I've never fully understood their meaning. How could I have, when there are people that scramble to take care of their family in an unfamiliar country, far away from their homes and loved ones, a country whose language they don't speak and whose culture they don't understand? I, meanwhile, manage to spend a small fortune on coffee every week, not thinking about where that money could go instead, and what, other than fueling my rather unhealthy addiction to caffeine, could be done with it. I struggle with deciding whether or not I've earned the right to be writing about such a sensitive topic, because really, how is my opinion relevant? It could almost be labelled as hypocritical, writing about the struggles of others, yet not truly grasping the concept. I'm not in a position to say I know what it feels like to live in a constant state of uncertainty and fear, knowing that tomorrow is not guaranteed. I realize all of this, but I also believe that my being silent would be ignorant. I'd rather be labelled as naive than sit around, completely useless. As much of a cliché as it may be, they don't say that silence is compliance for nothing.

Often, my guilt is just a way to bury my anger. Like a house of cards, it stays mostly stable but is always on the verge of crumbling down, until it inevitably collapses and its pieces fall, one by one. The anger at how one man can cause so much pain, anger at my privilege and the hardship of others. The fact that, although there are people that are better off than my family, there are also many that get by a lot worse with much less. I've always believed that everything happens for a reason, even if it's not clear in the moment. Bearing that in mind, I struggle to justify why my biggest worry is doing well on an exam, whilst others worry for their lives and dread the idea of a future that resembles the realities of today. We're separated only by the country we were born in, yet our lives differ so widely. I get to plan out what lies ahead of me, presented with countless opportunities to do mostly whatever I want with my life, whereas many sacrifice the hopes of their future for their nation. Often blinded by our entitlement, we take for granted things such as access to clean water and food, having a place to call home and freedom of choice, but should never forget that this is not the case for the majority of people. Time after time, the world has proven that not everything has a reason, but instead, things often simply fall to chance and the circumstances surrounding it. A case of a person being in the wrong place at the wrong time. It would be easier to make peace with that and go on with our day-to-day lives, but it's important we recognize our privilege and strive to use it for the greater good. One way or another, all of our lives are intertwined and the actions of a single person can set a thousand others into motion, sometimes correcting the unexplainable injustices of our world.

I wanted to write a conclusion that would tie everything together, a neat ending to all that's been said. But if there's anything I've learnt during these confusing times, it's that the chaos and disorder are not coming to a close any time soon, and neither should the conversations surrounding them. So instead, mentioned below is a list of organizations that continuously work to make change for the better, not only working on the frontlines in Ukraine, but all around the world.

- Project HOPE
- United24
- The International Committee of the Red Cross
- Člověk v tísni
- UNICEF
- Doctors Without Borders
- Refugees International
