“Mommy, I want to be an astronaut one day.” We’ve all been there. Already at a young age we tend to think about the future and what we’ll grow up to be.  As children we have big dreams with no limits, but the older we grow the less we let ourself believe that those dreams can come true. In high school, we are faced with the ultimate two questions: “What university will you go to? What job do you want to have?”
Some people may have that figured out already and see themselves as for example doctors or lawyers, but many of us are still completely clueless. Choosing what you want to study and be one day is a big decision, and many students find the idea stressful. There are many techniques that can help you narrow down your options. 

1. Looking at your strengths and skills  
	You can start by noticing the things you feel more confident about. Some people are great teamworkers, others excel when they work alone in a quiet environment. You may love to work on the computer and also stay organized when you have your files online. The soft skills that you acquire will help to shape the direction you will head towards.

2. Knowing you goals and values
	We all have different priorities and values that we put forth. These can include financial security, social justice or work life balance. It’s important to make sure that these align with what we want to pursue. For example, if you know you want to have a lot of hobbies aside from your job, choosing a job that will ensure a good work life balance will be important. 

3. Choosing your degree or your course at higher education
	If you have already chosen a course or degree that you are interested in, it is crucial to make sure you know what jobs you will be able to have once you finish studying. Moreover, knowing how competitive the field you’d like to work in is going to help you decide whether it's the right option for you, and whether you are willing to put in the hard work. 

4. What are my interests 
	This seems like a straightforward one, but it can also help you shape what you’ll become one day. Sometimes it's hard to figure out what your interests are. For a start you can ask yourself these questions: 
What do I spend most of my free time doing?
When do I feel happiest? 
What are some things I used to do and now I miss? 
Knowing your interests or hobbies will help you to get to know yourself and make a better judgement about your future school and field of interest.   

Test it out 
	Once you have chosen a few options to look into, research and test them out. There are many available courses for all fields of study. These courses are usually over the summer. Attending a course will help you either reassure yourself that you have chosen the right thing for you or realize that maybe you should keep on searching. Many top universities like Harvard or Oxford offer these summer courses for highschoolers. 

These five tips will hopefully help you to narrow down your options and guide you through this difficult process. Finding out what you want to pursue is a hard task, but don’t feel discouraged. Instead, start researching soon to learn about yourself and your interests.
