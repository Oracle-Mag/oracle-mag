Have you ever been in a situation where you feel like the whole world is against you? As if all the bad things suddenly started targeting you? Or perhaps something took a turn for the worse and it simply got you into an uncomfortable position? 
Well, naturally the average human response to this is to start feeling irritated or overwhelmed and therefore it can lead to acting on the spot and later regretting those actions. 

I would like to introduce you to an old philosophy, formed by the ancient philosopher Zeno, that can be applied in crisis situations, and has worked very well for myself and countless others. 
The stoic philosophy is based on the fact that the world is unpredictable and therefore despite us not always being able to control whatever is happening to us 'aka external circumstances', we can always control how we react and respond to it. Its main purpose is to develop self control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions.

In order to be able to achieve this so-called rationality, we need to try to expect the worst possible outcome of every situation so we are then prepared for it. This mentality can help us to not freak out when it actually happens.

Understandably, this approach may seem very pessimistic, however when you actually have in mind the worst possible outcome of a situation, conversation, or any event, it doesn't mean it will come true. It only works as a tool in favor of being aware that most situations aren't detrimental nor fatal and they are possible to resolve without us being extremely panicked or discomforted in any other way. Stoicism focuses on lowering our expectations and focusing on the bigger picture rather than on small details. The word "stoic" itself can be explained as "unemotional" 
 or indifferent to pain. The Stoics did not seek to extinguish emotions; rather, they sought to transform them; enabling a person to develop clear judgment and inner calm. Logic, reflection, and focus were the methods of such self-discipline. Temperance is split into self-control, discipline, and modesty. When we dive a bit deeper into this philosophy, its primary aspect involves improving the individual's ethical and moral well-being; "to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy" and to accept everyone equally, despite their status, as we are all 'products of nature'  

In real life, practicing stoicism is very beneficial for those who tend to freak out easily and let emotion get the best of them. Since you get to learn to respond to stimuli at a slower pace, it creates a time frame to actually process what has happened to you and gives you space to think it through.
